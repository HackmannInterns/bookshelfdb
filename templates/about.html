            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p class="first">This is a library started by John Hackmann. He gathered up his interns to help sort out and build a library that
                would be used to perserve many and all kinds of books. John Hackmann was a stanford grad.... some more
                background about John. About how he started this library, some more background in terms of why he likes books. 
                <br>

                <br> 
                This is a website template started by John Hackmann. The purpose of this library is to have a storage and catalogue for anyone who has a large collection of 
                books that they need to sort through on an online database. This was all done by the interns of Hackmann.

                We use <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> to access to gather data on the books users enter onto our database. It has been a helpful
                tool and website in gathering data on whatever book that you so find in the Hackmann Library.
